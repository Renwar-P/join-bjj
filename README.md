## Features

The features included on the page are essential to a attractive website that is both informative and personal. 

- Feature 1: Navigation Bar

To easily aid the website user the navigation bar is located inside the header on all pages. Inside the header there is also a image with a text displayed on it. The navigation bar contains the options of Home, Join and Gallery with links to the respective pages. In this way the user can quickly navigate around the pages without the need of having to go back a page.

- Feature 5: Gallery

The gallery section felt like a very obvious page to include. To give the website user the chance of viewing actual photos from the clubs training sessions, sparring and competition enhances the chances for a connection and a call to action. A picture says more then a thousands words. It is conviniently placed inside the navigation bar.

## Testing


This site has a couple of feautures that required testing.

  The footer section contains four correctly working links to the social media networks instagram, twitter, youtube and facebook.

-  Bugs
   - The middle section of club-message containing the images was a bit of a challenge in the beginning. With some trial an error i got the wanted outcome by changing the display to flex.   
   -  A reccuring bug that made it impossible to affect with CSS code was the lacking of the link element in the HTML structure. The first time it happened I spend some time to figure out the problem. When it became clear that nothing happened when I typed in CSS code, I understood that there must be a problem with linking. 
    -  When fitting the contents to smaller screen sizes I noticed that the navigation bar content appeared partly on top of each other. I knew that the solution had to be within the media queries css code. After some trial and error I found the solution within the line-height property of the navigation bar menu. 
   -  When going threw the README file I noticed that the lastname label on signup form appeared above the wrong input field. At first I was convinced that the problem was within the HTML structure. But after going threw it I finally solved within the CSS code. I changed the font-size. 
- Unfixed Bugs  
  -  There are no unfixed bugs.

  - The color combinations used in this project is titled "Sleek & Modern" and came from canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/ I choose these colors because i felt that they would work with the overall themes and colors coming from the images.

By transforming what I had learned from the Love Running project I tested my new skills.To the middle section of the club message page I found the youtube course provided by SuperSimpleDev on HTML and CSS to be helpful. Heres is the adress to that course <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=13846s>
